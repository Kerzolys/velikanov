        Ivan Velikanov is a distinguished orchestra conductor, composer, and early music performer, born on March 5, 1986, in Suresnes, France. With a multicultural background encompassing French, Russian, and Israeli nationalities, he is fluent in English, French, Russian, and Italian. His career in music began with an exceptional academic foundation, having graduated from the Moscow State Conservatory twice: first in composition under Professor R. Ledeniov in 2009, and later in symphony and opera orchestra conducting under the tutelage of Professor Gennady Rozhdestvensky in 2012. He also studied harpsichord, organ, and continuo, broadening his musical expertise. Over the years, he further honed his skills through masterclasses with renowned conductors like Kurt Masur, Th. Currentzis, and Vladimir Jurowski, and assisted prominent figures in both Russian and international productions.

        In his professional journey, Velikanov has conducted numerous prestigious opera and ballet productions across various notable theaters. Since 2022, he has been a guest conductor at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and the State Opera Theatre in Varna, Bulgaria. His earlier engagements include conductor roles at theaters in Nizhniy-Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, and Saint Petersburg, where he directed acclaimed performances of both classic and contemporary works. Notably, he has led world premieres of reconstructed pieces, such as C. Pugni’s ballet Catarina, la figlia del bandito and A. Borodin’s unfinished opera Bogatyri, both of which were recognized at the “Golden Mask” contest in Moscow.

        Beyond opera and ballet, Velikanov has a robust presence in the world of symphonic music. Since founding the Tarussa Chamber Orchestra in 2014, he has conducted over 30 programs, showcasing works spanning from the 18th to the 21st centuries. His engagements as a symphony conductor have taken him across Europe, including tours in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Estonia. As a composer, Velikanov’s works include ballets, oratorios, and innovative orchestral arrangements, such as Schubert’s Der Tod und das Mädchen and Erlkönig, adapted for voice with symphony orchestra.

        Velikanov is also a passionate advocate for early music. In 2009, he established the “Alta Capella” ensemble, dedicated to Renaissance and Baroque music, and later founded the “La Renaissance” International Festival of Music and Dance, which ran in Moscow until 2019. His extensive knowledge of historically informed performance practice, particularly from the 18th century, enriches his interpretations of classical compositions, often leading his ensembles from the harpsichord to ensure stylistically accurate renditions.
